== Description ==

= EXTEND THE BLOCK EDITOR =

Additional Gutenberg custom blocks to make it easy to get the most value out of the block-based editor.

ATHEMES BLOCKS CURRENTLY INCLUDE CONTAINER BLOCKS ONLY TO HELP YOU COMBINE DIFFERENT BLOCKS IN A SINGLE ROW AND MORE ARE COMING SOON.

= FREE COMPANION THEME =

aThemes Blocks works with any WordPress theme, but to unlock its full potential, it requires a Gutenberg-first theme. That’s why we created [Botiga - A Gutenberg first WooCommerce theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/botiga/) with Full-site editing in mind.
