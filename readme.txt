Extend the Gutenberg Block Editor with additional functionality.

== Description ==

== EXTEND THE BLOCK EDITOR ==

With aThemes Blocks, you can extend the Gutenberg block editor with additional functionality. 

CURRENTLY, ATHEMES BLOCKS INCLUDE A RESPONSIVE CONTAINER BLOCK WITH ADVANCED SETTINGS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ADD MULTIPLE BLOCKS IN A SINGLE ROW.

Our responsive container block lets you:

* Add up to six columns to each row
* Set a different text and background color combination for each block within the same row
* Access the default settings of each block (e.g. font settings for text blocks, sizing and alignment settings for image blocks, etc.)
* Customize the overall style of the container (content width, border radius, z-index, content alignment, background, spacing, and more)
* Define different layouts and styles for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
* Create complex layouts easily, without the use of a page builder plugin

As the plugin is under active development... MORE ATHEMES BLOCKS ARE COMING SOON!
